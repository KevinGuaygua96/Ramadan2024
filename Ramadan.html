            <h1>Day 1:</h1>
            <h2>Tuesday 12th March 2024</h2>
            <p>Now, you're probably wondering why I've started this diary on the 12th, and not the 10th.<br>
                This is because I've been away for the weekend, where there was a lot of drinking and sinful moments.<br>
                I figured it would be unfair to myself and rude if I made a mockery of this beautiful religion.<br>
                And that is why I've started the fasting practice on this day, I wanted to start off fresh.<br>
                I won't be praying or anything like that, as I feel like I ain't there yet.<br>
                So until then, it's just fasting.<br>
                I'm going to try and log my daily experience as much as I can, I'll be logging in the times for both <t>suhur</t> and <t>iftar</t>,<br>
                what I've eaten and how I'm feeling throughout the day.<br>
                I don't know if I can make the full month, but I'll try my best and take it day by day, and hopefully accomplish some sort of spiritual discipline.
