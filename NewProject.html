    <h1>Welcome to My "Ramadan?"</h1>
    <p class="a">Hi everyone,this is just a quick project I'm working on just to familiarise
        myself with HTML and CSS.<br>
        I studied ICT in college and passed with a Level 3 Extended Diploma Certificate,
            with a final grade of MMD,<br> which was enough to get me accepted into
            The University of Northampton to study Computing.<br>
            But I soon then realised, further education wasn't for me,
            so I dropped out and just been working in hospitality ever since then.</p>
            <h2>Ramadan</h2>
            <p>So for this project, I'll be blogging my first experience with fasting throughout<br>
            the month of Ramadan, which starts on the evening og Sunday 10th March 2024, and ends on<br>
            Tuesday 9th April 2024.<br>
                <br>
            The reason why I'm partaking in this is because, I have thought about this for a while
            ever since Covid years.<br>
            And I've put it off since then up until a couple months ago, when I decided to stop eating pork for good,<br>
            and because I don't want to drink as much as I used to.<br>
            I feel like this would be a big step in my personal life and lifestyle.<br>
            I feel this would make me appreciate myself a lot more, <br> something that I haven't been doing as of lately.<br>
            I don't know what to expect from this, or what I will achieve.<br>
            But I hope I can finally find peace within myself and see where it takes me.<br>
            <br>
                <hr>
                <p>Before I explain what Ramadan is, I just want to let everyone know,<br>
            I am not Muslim, I am not a Christian or Catholic.<br>
            I am from Ecaudor, a Catholic country, and I was raised this way.<br>
            But growing up later on in my young adult and adult years,<br>
            I've had no connection to God whatsover, I believed in Atheism,<br>
            and that was it.<br>
            But as I've gotten older, I've started to understand things more clearly,<br>
            but, I'm just still a bit unsure about it.<br>
            And that is why I see myself as an individual who is an Agnostic Atheist.<br>
            And that's not to say I'm against religion or anything like that,<br>
            I just haven't been given some sort of sign to have some belief.<br>
            I am very much open to it, whether it's Islam or Christianity.<br>
            <br>
            As I've said before, I don't expect much from this experience,<br>
            but I do hope for some sort of better understanding,<br>
            spiritually and mentally.<br>
            But what I do hope for myself is to learn to love myself more,<br>
            and appreciate life.</p>

            <h2>So what is Ramadan?</h2>
            <p>Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims all over the world
                as a month of fasting, reflection and community.<br>
                This is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and usually lasts for 29 to 30 days<br>
                from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next.<br>
                Fasting from dawn to sunset is obligatory for all adult Muslims<br>
                who either not chronically ill, travelling, breastfeeding, diabetic or menstruating.<br>
                <br>
                The predawn meal is referred to as <t>suhur</t>,<br>
                and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called <t>iftar</t>.<br>
                Although islamic laws have been issued declaring Muslims who live in regions with a <br>
                <t>midnight sun</t> or <t>polar night</t> should follow the timetable of <t>Mecca</t>.<br>
                It is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night<br>
                can be distinguished from day.<br>
                <br>
                The spiritual rewards of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan.<br>
                During the hours of fasting, Muslims refrain from not only food and drink,<br>
                but also tobacco products, sexual relations and sinful behaviour,<br>
                instead dveoting themselves to prayer and study the Quran.<br>
